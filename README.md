This theme is inspired by the Serika color scheme, most popular used by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com)

*Note:* This is mostly my personal theme and I put it in the community themes more for reference and hacking starting point, then to provide a complete theme experience. Especially the `eww` config might include several semi-broken and commented out bits, as I am working on these parts every now and then.

Dependencies:
- eww
- custom xkb keyboard layout "vou"
- Hasklug Nerd Font Mono

The wallpaper is rendered with blender from a modified version of a geometry nodes demo file by [James Redmond](twitter.com/redjam_9)
