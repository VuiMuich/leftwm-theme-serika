This theme is inspired by the Serika color scheme, most popular used by [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com)

*Note: This is mostly my personal theme and I put it in the community themes more for reference and hacking starting point, then to provide a complete theme experience. Especially the `eww` config might include several semi-broken and commented out bits, as I am working on these parts every now and then.*

Dependencies:

- [eww]([GitHub - elkowar/eww: ElKowars wacky widgets](https://github.com/elkowar/eww))
- custom xkb keyboard layout ["vou"](https://www.maximilian-schillinger.de/vou-layout.html) by Maximilian Schillinger
  (copy the `vou-xkb-layout` file to `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/custom` and select it with `setxkbmap custom vou`)
- [Hasklug Nerd Font Mono]([nerd-fonts/patched-fonts/Hasklig at master · ryanoasis/nerd-fonts · GitHub](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hasklig))

Use the snippet of the color scheme to get serika colors in `alacritty`.
